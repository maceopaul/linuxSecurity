Network security consists of the policies, 
processes and practices adopted to prevent, detect and monitor unauthorized access,
misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network-accessible resources.[1] 
Network security involves the authorization of access to data in a network, 
which is controlled by the network administrator. Users choose or are assigned 
an ID and password or other authenticating information that allows them access 
to information and programs within their authority. Network security covers a 
variety of computer networks, both public and private, that are used in 
everyday jobs: conducting transactions and communications among businesses, 
government agencies and individuals. 

Network security starts with authentication, commonly with a username and a password. Since this requires just one detail authenticating the user name—i.e., the password—this is sometimes termed one-factor authentication. With two-factor authentication, something the user 'has' is also used (e.g., a security token or 'dongle', an ATM card, or a mobile phone); and with three-factor authentication, something the user 'is' is also used (e.g., a fingerprint or retinal scan).
